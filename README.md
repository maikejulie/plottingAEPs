# Visualizing AEPs of varying complexities
A plotting tool for the Agregated Eco-Provinces (AEP) produced by the SAGE method presented in Sonnewald et al. Sonnewald et al.: Elucidating Ecological Complexity: Unsupervised Learning determines global marine eco-provinces.

The hope is that exploring the utility of the AEPs will be facilitated. The complexity of the AEPs are the level of aggregation applied. The hope is that regional applications will be able to use regions within the global plots at higher complexity, while more global studies may want to use lower complexities. 

We strongly recomend that a complexity lower than 12 is avoided as described in Sonnewald et al.

The data are on Zenodo:

- Nutrient, phytoplankton and zooplankton data: https://zenodo.org/record/3579369
- Grid data: https://zenodo.org/record/3697102
